# Bioinformatics-CRISPR-dCAS9-imaging
This respository contains some of the code that I had used in our publication:

"Live cell imaging of low- and non-repetitive chromosome loci using CRISPR-Cas9",Peiwu Qin, Mahmut Parlak, Cem Kuscu, Jigar Bandaria, Mustafa Mir, Karol Szlachta,Ritambhara Singh, Xavier Darzacq, Ahmet Yildiz, & Mazhar Adli, *Nature Communications*, **2017**

This repository contains the following files.

Bash scripts :
1. "BAM_workup_all.sh", "analyze_bam_files.sh" and "compare_ngg.sh". The first two scripts are used to generate all the potential sgRNAs in the human genome (hg19). These are further analyzed by the jupyter notebooks in the repository. "compare_ngg.sh" is used at the end of the analysis to confirm all that the sequences agree with criteria in the manuscript.
